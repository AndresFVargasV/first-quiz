Well, based on some knowledge I have about Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking, I could say that I would take the following 6 points to ensure better security in my system: 

1. Broken Access Control:
- The first thing is that I would implement proper access controls to ensure that users can only access the resources they have permission to and not have a free path to all the services of my software.
- I would have to ensure this by performing extensive testing to ensure that users cannot access unauthorized resources.

2.  Sensitive Data Exposure:
- Here, I would ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords, are stored securely and encrypted in the database.

3. Security Misconfiguration:
- The third thing is to take a good look at and secure the configuration of my Kubernetes environment, databases and other infrastructure components.
- I would achieve this by implementing security principles in the configuration and access to these services.

4. Protection against DDoS Attacks:
- In this fourth point, a good way to have security in my software is to use protection services against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks to mitigate the risk of service interruptions.

5. Penetration Testing and Security Assessments:
- As part of finding vulnerability, I would ideally perform regular penetration tests to identify and correct potential unwanted access doors in my software.
- In addition, I would also perform code security assessments to detect security issues before implementing new features.

6. Security Education:
- Last but not least, I believe it would be necessary to conduct cyber security trainings to all employees to increase awareness and promote secure practices.

In conclusion, I think these would be the 6 most important points that I would take into account to maintain a good security practice in my software and ensure that all data and its users are safe from any attack or vulnerability.
